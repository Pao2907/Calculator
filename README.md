# GUI 
GUI Stands for "Graphical User Interface". It offers visual representations of the available commands and functions of an operating system or software program using graphical elements such as tabs, buttons, scroll bars, menus, icons, pointers and windows. GUI allows users to easily access and manipulate available functions. Graphical user interface design principles conform to the model–view–controller software pattern, which separates internal representations of information from the manner in which information is presented to the user, resulting in a platform where users are shown which functions are possible rather than requiring the input of command codes.
